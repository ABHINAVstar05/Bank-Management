# Bank-Management-
This is the 1st management system based project which I made in my 1st semester in college in 2020. 
This project is made using C++ programming language.

This project is a bank management based project which starts with Login/Register options for the user. 
It further moves ahead to give options like deposit and/or withdraw money and to see details of the user account if he/she enters his/her correct account number and related password otherwise it throws an error saying invalid input.
